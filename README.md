## Articles
In [this](https://github.com/jlggross/articles) repository you can find a series of articles I wrote talking about topics on Operational Systems, Linux/Shell, Python, Data Science libraries for data manipulation (```numpy```, ```pandas```) and data visualization (```matplotlib```, ```seaborn```), and others.

I found articles to be a good way to exercise some of the information I just learned and that I think are worth sharing with the community. Also, articles ideas are always welcomed. Contact me!
